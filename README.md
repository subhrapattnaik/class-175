Now we will take two arrays (A & B) for
compounds which can be formed with
just two elements (like NaCl, KCl):
● One with elements that can lose
electrons to form compounds that
are elements like Na (Sodium), K
(Potassium), Li (Lithium) and H
(Hydrogen).



● And another one with elements
that need electrons to form
compounds that are elements like
F (Fluorine), Cl (Chlorine), Br
(Bromine) and I (Iodine).


we can
now calculate the distance.
For this we are going to use the Three.js
method distanceTo().
For example elA.distanceTo(elB) will
give distance between elA and elB,
where elA and elB are position vectors
as Three.js objects.
